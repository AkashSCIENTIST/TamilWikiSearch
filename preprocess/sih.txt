Honorable Gentlemen,
I'm sending this mail on my team's behalf. I would like to let you know that our team is presently unable to perform a demo due to our commitment to the upcoming 8 to 10 months of academics, ongoing tests, and placement classes. After every member of the team has been assigned a position, we will be able to work directly on a project once more.
